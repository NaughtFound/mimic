# mimic

A modular PyTorch dataset library for working with [MIMIC-CXR-JPG](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr-jpg/) and [MIMIC-IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/) datasets.

This library provides ready-to-use dataset classes and a clean `BaseDataset` abstraction to help researchers quickly build and experiment with MIMIC-derived datasets.

## üß± Creating Custom Datasets

To define your own dataset, subclass `BaseDataset` and implement two things:

- `_files()`: a list of files to download from [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org).
- `collate_fn()`: how to batch items together for the `DataLoader`

That's it ‚Äî no need to redefine PyTorch boilerplate.

```python
from mimic.datasets import BaseDataset

class MyDataset(BaseDataset):
    def _files(self) -> dict:
        # Prepare your list of files or samples
        return {...}

    def collate_fn(self, batch:list[int]):
        # Define how samples should be combined into a batch
        return ...
```
